## About

## Usage

## Installation

The general command that you have to hit is by using the `setup.py` script, i.e.

```python3
  python3 setup.py install
```

Again, if you want to install it locally because you don't have administrative rights
in your computer you can just simply type

```python3
  python3 setup.py install --user
```

If you want to develop on the code, you can also alternatively hit

```python3
  python3 setup.py develop --user
```
